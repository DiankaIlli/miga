This is the /apps directory - it is meant to hold information about each
"app" powered by this Miga installation. Each app (there may just be one)
should have its own directory within /apps, holding one or more of the
following:

* CSV files, holding the structured data (if any) of this app
* a .ini file describing the data schemas of the CSV file(s)
* HTML files, for any static content pages that the app holds
* a logo image
* a favicon image
* an "app icon" image (used for screen shortcuts on mobile devices)
* a CSS file, to override the main CSS settings
* importer settings files for any of the CSV files that are generated with
an importer.

(This README file exists for two reasons: to explain the /apps directory,
and because Git does not allow empty directories in the source tree.)
